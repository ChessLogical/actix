My first ib in rust. The higher the directory number the more developed. This is a gem for starting an ib... pick a stage in its dev and make it into whatever you want. No restrictions on the code... just do not say its yours tho because i made it and it is open source. This repo is to encourage others to code boards in Rust- this repo is for the love of Rust lang.
