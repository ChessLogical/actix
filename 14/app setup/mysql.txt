SELECT user, host, authentication_string, plugin FROM mysql.user WHERE user='root';

If the plugin is auth_socket, it means MySQL is using socket-based authentication and doesn't require a password when logged in as root on the server. In this case, you might want to switch to the mysql_native_password plugin.
Yes, it's okay to leave auth_socket authentication for the root user if you're only developing the application and the environment is not exposed to the internet. The auth_socket plugin allows local system users to log in to MySQL without requiring a password, which can simplify local development.

However, for production environments, it's recommended to use password-based authentication to enhance security. Since this is a development environment, you can proceed with auth_socket.
